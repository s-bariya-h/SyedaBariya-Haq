### Problem Statement

<br>
As Software Quality Engineer you are given a task of testing a RESTful API. Use the Swagger Petstore Sample training tool designed to learn about an API framework on a local environment. Set up your environment as explained in the readme

#### API automation task

- Set up the API playground and run it locally.
- A list of test cases proposed for automation.
- Please automate proposed test cases.
- A short explanation of the provided solution.

- API Platform Used: https://petstore3.swagger.io/ (Locally Setup)
  <br/><br/>

### ðŸ’¡ Philosophy

- For the given API playground, https://petstore3.swagger.io/, there can be a many test cases but due to the time constraint I am testing some of the test cases to give the recruiters an idea that I am capable of setting up the environment and carry out the automated tests.
- Some of the test cases are performed which are related to `POST`, `GET` and `DELETE` requests to clear the testing concept for each of them which can be similarly done to other test cases.
- Cypress.io is easy to understand tool and provides good integration with other tools like docker. It is also used because it has fast execution. Docker containers are used so the same image can easily be seen when it is executed on any other machine.

### ðŸ“‹ Test Cases:

- Overview
  - The test cases are created for a pet store backend having API calls regarding the pet status in the store `POST`, `GET` and `DELETE` requests.
  - We are only considering **True cases**. 
  - The requests for pet can be replicated for orders and users.
  - `Home-Challenge/Task3/cypress/config/config.js` file contains sample schemas to test.

Click each of the following Case IDs to expand

<details>
  <summary>Case ID_01: GET Request</summary>
  <br/>
  <blockquote>

#### Work Flow

1. GET Request - `/pet/{petId}` Get Pet by ID

---

#### Assessment

- Send a `GET`request with `id = petExampleValue.id` from `config.js` file
- Check if the headers' content type is `application/json`
- Check if the status code returned is `200`
- Check that status code should not return `404` or`400`
- Check if the body of the response is JSON
- Check if the body of the response matches the example schema (keys matching)

  </blockquote>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Case ID_02: POST Request</summary>
  <br/>
  <blockquote>

#### Work Flow

1. POST - `/pet` Add a new pet to the store
2. GET - `/pet/{petId}` Get Pet by ID

---

#### Assessment

- Send a `POST` request with the `myPetExample` object as body from the `config.js` file
- Check if the status code returned is `200`
- Check that status code should not return `405`
- Check if the body of the response matches the `myPetExample` object (keys matching)
- Send a `GET` request with `id = myPetExample.id`
- Check if the status code returned is `200`
- Check that status code should not return `404` or`400`
- Check if the body of the response is JSON
- Check if the body of the response matches the example schema (keys matching)
- Check random values from the response to match the values of `myPetExample` object

  </blockquote>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Case ID_03: DELETE Request</summary>
  <br/>
  <blockquote>

#### Work Flow

1. DELETE - /pet/{petId} Delete pet by ID
2. GET - /pet/{petId} Get Pet by ID

---

#### Assessment

ðŸ©¹ Since our `myPetExample` pet is still there as a result of the POST request in the last test, we will use that.
- Send a DELETE request by `id = myPetExample.id`
- Check if the status code returned is `200`
- Check that status code should not return `400`
- Send a GET request with `id = myPetExample.id`
- GET request should return `404`

### :wrench: Usage

#### Pre-requisites:

- Docker and docker-compose must be installed
- An account on hub.docker.com would save you from unforeseen errors

#### Steps:

- Clone the repository
- Go to the `Home-Challenge/Task3` directory
- In the terminal, Run `docker-compose up`

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

- You will see the test cases running.
- If you want to see/edit the content of the test file, go to `Home-Challenge/Task3/cypress/integration/specs.js`
- `specs.js` files follows the generic content in the `Home-Challenge/Task3/cypress/config/config.js` file.
- If you edit the tests and run again, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the container, and then run `docker-compose up` again.
